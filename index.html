                    The goal of this project is to write software that converts a Markdown file (.md) into an HTML file (.html). It should have multiple moving parts that connect and ensure a proper build. This project includes writing my own HTML class that can be used to build complex HTML or XML trees and a rendering class that allows for fast revision. With speed as a concern, I've set a goal of rendering 1,000,000 lines in less than 1 second - an ambitious but not impossible goal.

                    The goal of this project is to write software that optimizes builds for the game Wynncraft. Creating a "build" is time-consuming and can result in not achieving the best possible setup. With this tool, creating or theorizing a new build becomes easy. From saving hours or even days to potentially saving in-game currency, this application will help many players.                </p>

                    This project is currently in the planning stage. The goal is to create a device that can aid in locating a radio emitter within a 2-foot radius of its actual position. All math, reasoning, and build instructions will be thoroughly documented to allow others to rebuild and improve upon the project.

                    This project was created to begin my development journey in C#. It's simple, but I feel it was a great beginner project. With a graph that shows the curve that a projectile object would follow and a simple interface, this application served as a solid starting point for learning C#.

                    This project was created to improve the efficiency of installing Arch Linux. I frequently had to flash new computers to test different desktop environments, packages, and projects I was building. This program was developed at a time when I didn't have hardware powerful enough to run a virtual machine. The first iteration was written in C++, and the second in shell.

                    Creating my webpage will be an on-going project. For now, my initial goal is complete as I have created a page to highlight my various projects - showcasing what I've made and what I'm currently working on. I also want this page to reflect my growth in graphic design. Hopefully, there will be a steady and noticeable improvement over time.
